# RavenfallAutobot
A simple Javascript bot that auto-reacts to raids and dungeons in Ravenfall, joining them

You can access the bot by going to the following URL

drewbanyai.github.io/RavenfallAutobot/?channel=XXXXX&username=YYYYY&token=ZZZZZ

Just replace:
- XXXXX with the twitch channel name in all lowercase characters
- YYYYY with the twitch account name used to run RavenBot on that stream in all lowercase
- ZZZZZ with your auth token, minus the "auth:" at the beginning

If you don't have your oauth generated, you can do so here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

-----

If the oauth is detected as belonging to the stream channel owner, you'll see some admin abilities such as the !help command reply bot
